Feature selection… is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction.

Feature selection is different from dimensionality reduction. Both methods seek to reduce the number of 
attributes in the dataset, but a dimensionality reduction method do so by creating new combinations of attributes,
where as feature selection methods include and exclude attributes present in the data without changing them.

Examples of dimensionality reduction methods include Principal Component Analysis,
Singular Value Decomposition and Sammon’s Mapping
