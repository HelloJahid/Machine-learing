Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most exciting fields of Machine Learning today, and also one of the oldest. 
In Reinforcement Learning, a software agent makes observations and takes actions within an environment, and in 
return it receives rewards. Its objective is to learn to act in a way that
will maximize its expected long-term rewards.
