Time series forecasting is challenging, especially when working with long sequences, noisy data,
multi-step forecasts and multiple input and output variables. Deep learning methods offer a lot
of promise for time series forecasting, such as the automatic learning of temporal dependence
and the automatic handling of temporal structures like trends and seasonality
